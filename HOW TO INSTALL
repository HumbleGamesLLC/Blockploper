Hey there! I am glad you want to try my first game! Be sure to read the "READ ME.md", Once you do go to the "Unnamed Project 1.exe" and click download once you are there
Or you can either click "view raw" and it will take a few seconds to download cause the game is so small
Click run (Settings don't matter cause this game is very weak)
Have fun!
If you have any small suggestions that you think I could add like scenery or others, please click "Issues" tab here and create and issue! Or you can contact me on discord!
:)
